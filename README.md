# 🎯 TruthCard AI – Roast Your Dating Profile

> 💬 *Honesty is the best policy — even when it hurts.*

**TruthCard AI** is your brutally honest friend who tells you what *nobody else will* about your dating profile (or any image you upload). Whether it’s your bio, your photos, or your vibe, we’ll roast it with humor, sass, and a sprinkle of truth bombs.

## 🔥 Features

- **Profile Roasting**: Submit your dating profile text (like from Tinder, Bumble, Hinge) and get roasted by AI.
- **Image Analysis**: Upload a photo and let us tell you like it is — from fashion choices to questionable background details.
- **Anonymous & Fun**: No judgment here, just hilarious honesty.
- **Shareable Results**: Save or share your roast with friends (if you dare).

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Submit your dating profile text or upload an image.
2. Our AI analyzes your content using advanced algorithms (and a bit of sarcasm).
3. Get roasted in seconds with a detailed breakdown of what works... and what doesn’t.
4. Laugh, cringe, or maybe even learn something useful.
